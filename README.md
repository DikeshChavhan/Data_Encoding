Data Encoding Practical üìä‚ú®
---
Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Data Encoding Practical.ipynb) that demonstrates the implementation of essential Data Encoding techniques used in machine learning and data preprocessing. The core goal of these techniques is to convert non-numeric, categorical features into a numerical format that can be processed effectively by statistical models and algorithms. ü§ñüî¢

Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è
To run the notebook, you need Python 3.6+ and the following libraries:

pandas üêº

scikit-learn üß†

seaborn üìä (Used for loading the 'tips' dataset, though not for encoding directly)
---
Encoding Techniques Demonstrated üí°
Nominal Encoding (One-Hot Encoding) üè∑Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏èüî•
Used for categorical data where there is no inherent order (e.g., 'married', 'single', 'separated').
Tool Used: sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder

Key Concept: Each category is transformed into a binary (dummy) feature, preventing models from assuming an artificial ordinal relationship between categories. ‚úÖ

Alright, I'll enhance the GitHub README with some appropriate and visually appealing emojis! üöÄ‚ú®üìä

Project Overview

The core goal of these techniques is to convert non-numeric, categorical features into a numerical format that can be processed effectively by statistical models and algorithms. ü§ñüî¢

The notebook covers three major types of encoding: Nominal, Ordinal, and Target Guided Ordinal Encoding.

Label Encoding üè∑Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏èüî¢
A basic integer mapping, primarily used for binary categories or as a quick initial encoding.
Tool Used: sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder
Caution: This technique is generally not suitable for nominal data with more than two unique values, as the assigned integers introduce a false sense of magnitude/order (2>1>0). ‚ö†Ô∏è
